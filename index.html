    <p>Leena Klammer, better known as Esther Coleman or Esther Albright is the main antagonist of the 2009 horror film Orphan and the titular protagonist of its 2022 prequel Orphan: First Kill.  
        
    She is believed to be a 9-year-old Russian girl who is currently residing with The Colemans as foster parents (Kate Coleman, John Coleman, Max Coleman, and Daniel Coleman). 
    She is an Estonian woman, 33, who suffers from hypopituitary disease that causes her to appear much younger than she really is.

    <h1> Biography </h1>
    <h2>Backstory </h2>
    <p class= "backstory" > Esther Coleman is said to be a mass killer
        who murdered the entire Sullivan family after deceiving them into adopting her by posing as a fugitive,
        She typically used her looks to rob people, but for some reason—possibly
        because the Sullivan father turned her down—she decided to kill these particular victims.
        She was apprehended for this and sent to the Saarne Institute. 
        She was one of the most erratic and aggressive patients, 
        always causing harm to the employees.
        These actions eventually led to her being placed in a straitjacket; 
        she would frequently escape from them owing to her fighting and resistance,
        but as a result, she sustained multiple scars.
        She would hide these wounds.</p>
    <i> Orphan: first kill </i>
    <p>Leena reportedly murdered an art therapist who did not follow safety protocols, 
       and Anna Troyev is hired to replace her. 
       Leena escapes the institute by murdering a security 
       guard who was attracted to her after luring him into her room. 
       She takes his key and hides in Anna's trunk, later murdering her with a tire iron. 
       Leena researches missing American girls and notices she bears a resemblance to a girl named Esther Albright, 
       and pretends to be her when a police officer finds her.
        </p> 
    <p cl> Leena fabricates a complex tale about how a woman kidnapped her and made her pose as her daughter. 
        Tricia, the mother of the Albright family, takes her in but realizes she seems differently; she doesn't recognize "her" grandmother's demise or what kind of bird her therapist had. 
        Later, it was discovered that Tricia knew Leena was a fake since the real Esther had been accidentally killed by her son Gunnar,
        and she had hushed it up without notifying her husband Allen. 
        To make sure her therapist and family friends buy the charade and no one finds out the truth about Esther's death,
        Tricia sends Leena detailed information about the real Esther's life. 
        A detective was murdered by Leena and Tricia after
        it was revealed that her fingerprints did not match.
    
        Gunnar and Tricia attempt to kill Esther when she is not phased by their blackmail attempts,
        and appears to be making romantic advances on Allen. 
        When Allen goes to an art gallery, Gunnar and Tricia try to stage a suicide, 
        but Esther manages to kill Gunnar with a crossbow, and accidentally sets the house on fire. 
        When Allen returns home and finds Esther and Tricia hanging from the roof during a struggle, 
        he saves Esther but Tricia falls to her death.
        After Esther's disguise comes off, he is disgusted , 
        and she pushes him off the roof to his death.
        Esther is last seen with her therapist discussing her 
        upcoming transferal to an adoption agency.

    <h1> PERSONALITY </h1>
    <p> At first glance, the Colemans see Esther as a quiet, peaceful, kind, and friendly girl with many talents.
        However, all of this is only a facade, and it is later revealed that Esther is not a child, 
        but instead a full-grown antisocial woman.
       Leena is an evil and manipulative woman who will do anything to satisy what she wants, such as blackmail,
       threats, attacks on their families, and causing them to suspect their own wives. 
       Besides her savage side, 
       Leena is extremely talented at playing piano and painting. 
       However, her paintings have a very dark and disturbing element to them under a blacklight.

        <span class="mw-headline" id="Trivia">Trivia</span>
    <ul> 
       <li> Despite that Orphan received mixed reviews, Esther Coleman was Isabelle Fuhrman's breakout role.</li>
       <li>During filming, Isabelle Fuhrman was around 12 year old, which is a juxtaposition to her character being 33.</li>
       <li>Esther is based off of real life 33-year-old Czech adoption imposter and psychopath named Babora Skarlova
           who passed as a little girl, then years later passed off as a 14-year-old Norwegian boy named Adam since she gained weight. 
           she tortured two children in her adoptive family and locked them up in cages, 
           then cannibalized one of them. 
           she was imprisoned but got released later on for good behavior.
          Her whereabouts today are currently unknown.</li>
        <li> Esther is likely a Cluster B Psychopath with Borderline,
         Histrionic and Narcissistic personality traits. 
         It is entirely possible that Esther has both 
         Antisocial Personality Disorder and 
         Borderline Personality Disorder.</li>
         <li>In the ending credits, you can see a photograph
             of her when she was in the Saarne Institute, 
             a torn paper about her disorder and her nationality, 
             and a torn photograph of The Sullivan family.</li>
